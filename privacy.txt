By proceeding to play Oractory, you agree to the use of localStorage on your device and the following. LocalStorage is a interface on Modern Browsers that is used to save data in your browser's storage. This allows Javascript to save and read things. This game uses it save, load, and update your save files. All data stays on your device, unless transferred elsewhere by file download, and is not shared to anywhere or anyone. As save files can be very large, the data the game might be very storage heavy. The game currently limits this to 5mb as it is the max for most browsers. Thank you for playing Oractory and have a great day =)
